       "* `Hyperexponential` - A continuous probability distribution that is a mixture (weighted sum) of\n",
       "    exponential distributions. It has a higher coefficient of variation than\n",
       "    a single exponential distribution, making it useful for modeling highly\n",
       "    variable processes or heavy-tailed phenomena.\n",
       "* `RawContinuousEmpirical` - A distribution that performs linear interpolation between data points according to \n",
       "    the algorithm described in Law & Kelton's \"Simulation Modeling and Analysis\".\n",

       "\n",
       "* `Gamma` fix of the calculation of the mean based on alpha and beta.\n",
