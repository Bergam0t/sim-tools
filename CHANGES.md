## [v0.10.0](https://github.com/TomMonks/sim-tools/releases/tag/v0.10.0)[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.16754108.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16754108)

### Added

* Add `sort` argument to `DistributionRegistry.create_batch()` for dict inputs, ensuring deterministic results if the config key order changes.
* Add `_validate_and_create()` to `DistributionRegistry` which checks that the distribution configurations are dictionaries with only two keys: "class_name" and "params".
* Add tests for the new `sort` argument and `_validate_and_create()` method.

### Changed

* Some linting of `_validation.py`, `time_dependent.py`, `distributions.py` and `trace.py`.

## [v0.9.1](https://github.com/TomMonks/sim-tools/releases/tag/v0.9.1)[[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.16754108.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16754108)]

### Added

* Add unit tests for all distributions which check it uses the base class, data types and sample size are correct, that the sample mean looks right, and that the random seed is working. Some similar tests existed, but they did not cover all distributions.
* Add some specific tests for `Lognormal` and `DiscreteEmpirical`.
* Add back tests for all distributions (which check that new samples are equal to those generated previously, when random seed controlled).

### Changed

* Adjusted docstrings to use a more consistent NumPy style.
* Some linting of `distributions.py`.

### Fixed

* `DiscreteEmpirical` - now allows any type of data to be included. For example, str, as well as numeric value.

## [v0.9.0](https://github.com/TomMonks/sim-tools/releases/tag/v0.9.0)  [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.15256118.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15256118)

### Added

* `distributions.DistributionRegistry` - for batch creation of standard distributions from a dictionary or list.  
* DOCS: `DistributionRegistry` explaination and examples including use of JSON to store configs.
* `distributions.spawn_seeds` function to support creation of PRNG streams.
* `Hyperexponential` - A continuous probability distribution that is a mixture (weighted sum) of
    exponential distributions. It has a higher coefficient of variation than
    a single exponential distribution, making it useful for modeling highly
    variable processes or heavy-tailed phenomena.
* `RawContinuousEmpirical` - A distribution that performs linear interpolation between data points according to 
    the algorithm described in Law & Kelton's "Simulation Modeling and Analysis".
* `sim_tools._validation`: internal module that contains common validation routines for `sim_tools` functions and classes.
* All distribution classes updated to include valudation of input parameters.
* DOCS: Dedicated page for using empirical distributions.

### Changed

* `Distribution` changed from abstract base class to `Protocol`.  All inheritance removed from concrete classes. 
* Added `__repr__()` to all distribution classes.
* DOCS: improved docstrings for all distribution classes
* BREAKING: `Discrete` -> `DiscreteEmpirical`
* BREAKING: `RawEmpirical` -> `RawDiscreteEmpirical`
* BREAKING: `ContinuousEmpirical` -> GroupedContinuousEmpirical`. To clarify the purpose of the emprical distribution
* BREAKING: `NSPPThinning`: class now only requires "mean_iat" column in `data`. Acceptance/rejection calcualted using $iat_{min} / iat_(t)$

### Fixed

* `Gamma` fix of the calculation of the mean based on alpha and beta.
* `GroupedContinuousEmpirical`: silent bug when `u` selects the first group.  Interpolation did not work correctly and sampled out of range. This now been handled by logic pre-sample.
* `NSPPThinning`: removed redundant outer loop from sampling.

## [v0.8.0](https://github.com/TomMonks/sim-tools/releases/tag/v0.8.0a) [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.15041282.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15041282)

### Added

* Add `simpy` and `treat-sim` to the environment, as these were required in the notebooks in `docs/`.
* Add `nbqa` and `pylint` to the environment for linting, plus a relevant files `lint.sh` and `.pylintrc`.
* Add tests for `output_analysis` functions (functional, unit and back tests).
* Add validation of parameters in `ReplicationsAlgorithm`.
* Add validation of data type in `OnlineStatistics`.

### Changed

* Simplified distribution value type tests to a single test where possible using `pytest.mark.parametrize`.
* Linted `.py` and `.ipynb` files using `pylint` (most addressed, some remain unresolved).
* Provided advice on tests, building docs and linting in the `README.md`.
* `00_front_page.md` now just imported `README.md` (reducing duplication, and keping it up-to-date).

### Removed

* Removed duplicate `sw21_tutorial.ipynb`.

### Fixed

* Within `confidence_interval_method`, convert data provided to `OnlineStatistics` to `np.array` so that it is actually used to update the class (when before, it was not, as it was a list).
